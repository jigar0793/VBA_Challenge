# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project

Using VBA, Steve wants to analyze an entire dataset. So, we are going to determine how stocks have performed in year 2017 & 2018 with the clock of a button. In this challenge, we are going to edit or refeactor the code that we have create through module and then will determine if that technique was an efficient. Refactoring technique helps analyst to save time and make them even more presentable. 

## Results

Steve wanted to find total daily volume and yearly return of each stocks during 2017 & 2018. By looking at the stocks for both year 2017 & 2018, we can clearly see that 2017 made huge profit while 2018 stocks went it losses.

### Refactoring Code

The results of timings shows that its was more efficient after refactoring or editing code for the process of analysis. no matter if there is difference of milliseconds. but when there is larger dataset it would definately make huge difference. By refactoring we are not adding any new functions but its just more efficient coding by improving logic and readabilty. By doing this, we do use fewer steps and system use less memory.

## Summary

In conclusion, using refactoring is much helpful for analysing datasets.

### Pros & Cons of refactoring code  

#### Pros:

1) Process is very efficient for analysing data.
2) Fewer Steps are used in coding.
3) Code Runs Faster with less memory used.

#### Cons:

1) Refactoring could be time-consuming.
2) It could introduce to new bugs.

### Pros & Cons of Original & Refactored VBA Script

Its almost same as above as by refactoring the reduces the steps, use of memory and process time. In compare to that, when there are bugs found while coding, it could be time consuming & expensive to debug.
